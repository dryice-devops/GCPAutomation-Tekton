As explained earlier, in this scenario you will build and test a client-server
system, where the client app and the server app are first built and inspected
separately (unit tests), then tested together (system tests). To achieve this,
Tekton must be aware of the order of tasks: it cannot run the system tests
until all the unit tests finish.

For simplicity reasons, this scenario provides five dummy tasks which you will
use:

* `build-client`: a task where the client app is built.
* `test-client`: a task where the client app is tested.
* `build-server`: a task where the server app is built.
* `test-client`: a task where the server app is tested.
* `system-test`: a task where the client app and the server app is tested side by side.

Note that these tasks are only dummies without inputs and outputs; they will
always complete without a failure. If you are interested, you can inspect
their specification at `tekton-examples/pipelines/src/tekton-katacoda/tasks`.

Apply these tasks with the command below:

`kubectl apply -f tekton-examples/pipelines/src/tekton-katacoda/tasks`{{execute}}

To connect these tasks in a specific order, add them in the pipeline with
the `runAfter` field configured in the pipeline specification. Open
`tekton-examples/pipelines/src/tekton-katacoda/pipelines/pipelineTemplate.yaml`
and edit the `spec.tasks` field:

```yaml
...
spec:
  tasks:
  - name: build-client
    taskRef:
      name: build-client
  - name: test-client
    taskRef:
      name: test-client
    # Run test-client only when build-client has completed
    runAfter:
    - build-client
  - name: build-server
    taskRef:
      name: build-server
  - name: test-server
    taskRef:
      name: test-server
    # Run test-client only when build-client has completed
    runAfter:
    - build-server
  - name: system-test
    taskRef:
      name: system-test
    # Run test-client only when both test-client and test-server has completed
    runAfter:
    - test-client
    - test-server
...
```

Note that you may specify multiple prerequisites in the pipeline, i.e.
to run the task `system-test`, both `test-client` and `test-server` must
complete.

With the `runAfter` syntax, Tekton will organize the tasks in this pipeline
into a directed acyclic execution graph and perform the CI/CD workflow in
the specified order:

![diagram](https://github.com/michaelawyu/tekton-examples/blob/master/pipelines/images/diagram.png?raw=true)

In addition the `runAfter` syntax, Tekton also provides the `from` syntax
for the use case where **the output of one task is the input of another task**.
For example, if `build-client` outputs an image which `test-client` must use,
you must use `from` instead of `runAfter` in the pipeline specification:

```yaml
...
spec:
  tasks:
  - name: build-client
    taskRef:
      name: build-client
    # This task outputs an image
    resources:
      outputs:
      - name: my-image
        resource: my-image
  - name: test-client
    taskRef:
      name: test-client
    # This task requires an image as input
    resources:
      inputs:
      - name: my-image
        resource: my-image
        # The input comes from the task `build-client`
        from:
        - build-client
...
```
